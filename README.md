# Predicting-Employee-Attrition
A machine learning project to predict employee attrition based on HR data. Implements data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a Random Forest classification model using Python. Includes features like model evaluation and feature importance analysis.

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict employee attrition based on historical HR data. The pipeline is implemented in Python using Scikit-learn.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Employee-Attrition.csv`, containing anonymized employee information.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning Model using Random Forest
- Metrics Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, etc.)

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Files
- **EmployeeAttrition.ipynb**: Main Python script for EDA.
- **Employee-Attrition.csv**: The dataset file.
- **Requirements.txt**: List of Python libraries required to run the script.
